            <h3>About me:</h3>
            <p>
              Always been fond of solving problems, even from an early age. In
              high school, I enjoyed math and I continued that dedication in
              college. Now, in my day-to-day life, I am strongly motivated and
              enthusiastic to solve problems.
            </p>
            <p>
              My background in civil engineering also provides me required
              knowledge, perspective and experience in solving problems, working
              on a technical projects with skilled as well as startups. So I
              completely left my career in Civil engineering and that led me to
              the world of programming. Now, I am constantly improving myself to
              get to a phase where I will be able to build new and innovative
              technologies.
